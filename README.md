Hack Mental Health @ UCSF 2019

5.7 million Americans live with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive mental disorder due to generalized degeneration of the brain.

Mindly is a chatbot designed to assist individuals in an early stage of Alzheimer's. The chatbot also provides memory exercises that focus on remembering the names and details of loved ones, recent events, and recent conversations. 

We used Google DialogueFlow and Google Firebase to implement tasks and functions of the chatbot and create a database. By deploying a Flask server, we used webhooks to connect to the chatbot.
